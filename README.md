# Precision Farming Project - Predicting Crop Yield using Random Forest Algorithm

Description: In this project, I used machine learning techniques to predict crop yield based on weather conditions, soil quality, fertilizer usage, and other relevant factors. I cleaned and preprocessed a publicly available dataset from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and used random forest regression algorithm to build a model that could accurately predict crop yield.

I also conducted data exploration and feature engineering to identify trends and correlations between features and crop yield, and to create new features that could improve the accuracy of the model. I optimized the model's performance by tuning hyperparameters such as the number of trees in the forest, the maximum depth of each tree, and the minimum number of samples required to split a node.

The project involved hands-on experience in data preprocessing, analysis, and modeling using Python and machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and pandas. The project culminated in the deployment of the model to make predictions on new data, and I also created a user interface for farmers to input their farming data and get predictions for crop yield.

Through this project, I gained valuable skills in machine learning and data science, and developed a practical solution to a real-world problem. I am excited to apply these skills in a professional setting and contribute to the field of precision agriculture.
